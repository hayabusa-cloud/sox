## sox(WIP)

asynchronous socket I/O and event notification library  
for low-latency realtime communication systems  
(in progress)

### Basic Concept
* Low-copy I/O implement for QUIC, TCP, UDP, SCTP and Unix domain sockets  
* Low kernel-userspace context switch implement for event notifications
* Compatible with low-lock programming

### Environment Requirements

Currently only supporting Linux system
